# Public Transport Victoria TimetableThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [Public Transport Victoria Timetable APIs](). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [Public Transport Victoria Timetable APIs]().They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/public-transport-victoria-timetable/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the Public Transport Victoria Timetable APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
